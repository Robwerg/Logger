Build your own low-cost datalogger with on-board storage, real-time clock, solar power and LoRa capability. 
For ease of construction and design we use break-out boards for each of the functions of the datalogger.
The logger can accommodate a range of sensor signals including voltage (16 bit resolution), current, SDI-12 and 1-wire communication.
